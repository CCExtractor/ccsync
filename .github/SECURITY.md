# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We aim to support the latest main branch. Security fixes may be backported on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, email security reports to the maintainers or use GitHub's private reporting if enabled.

We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days and work with you on a fix timeline.
